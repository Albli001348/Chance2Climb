# Chance2Climb
Little project which uses Python tools such as BeautifulSoup and Tweepy to gather weather of climbing spots near Santa Barbara and post them on twitter. The end goal is to load this program onto something like a Raspberry Pi and have the bot post daily updates. In the future, I might expand this project by having the bot message users personalized lists of climbing spots through twitter and create a feature which allows users to suggest new climbing spots to the list.

Currently only supports finding the weather for Brickyard and Gibraltar Rock and lacks the ability to post to Twitter.
